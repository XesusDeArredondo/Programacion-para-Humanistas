    "3: The locks yawned loose and a blast blew them wide",
    "4: He dropped where he loved on the burst pavement stone",
    "5: And the funeral grains of the slaughtered floor",
    "6: Tell his street on its back he stopped a sun",
    "7: And the craters of his eyes grew springshots and fire",
    "8: When all the keys shot from the locks, and rang",
    "9: Dig no more for the chains of his grey-haired heart",
    "10: The heavenly ambulance drawn by a wound",
    "11: Assembling waits for the spade's ring on the cage",
